    <h2>About mruby</h2>
    <p class="mruby-is">
    mruby is the lightweight implementation of the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby language</a> complying to (part of) the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579">ISO standard</a>. mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby compiler "mrbc". All those tools reside in the "bin" directory. "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory for an example.
