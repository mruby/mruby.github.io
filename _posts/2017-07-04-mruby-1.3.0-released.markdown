## What's new in mruby 1.3.0

### The safe navigation operator (`&.`)

mruby 1.3 now supports the safe navigation operator (`&.`) to help handle nil
value returned from methods. This feature comes from Ruby 2.3.

By using the safe navigation operator, you can simply write

```
account&.owner&.address
```

Instead of writing

```
account && account.owner && account.owner.address
```

Or (with ActiveSupport)

```
account.try(:owner).try(:address)
```

### `Array#dig`, `Hash#dig`

`#dig` is a method to retrieve a value from JSON-like nested Array/Hash structures.

This feature also comes from Ruby 2.3.

For example:

```
params.dig(:account, :owner, :address)
```

Instead of

```
account = params[:account]
owner = account[:owner]
owner[:address]
```

### `Object#freeze`

You can now "freeze" an object by using Object#freeze.

Frozen objects cannot be modified.

### `Kernel#caller`

You can retrieve call frame information by using `Kernel#caller`.
